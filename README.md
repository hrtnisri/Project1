# Project 1
This is my python notebook for the project entitled "Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing: using Python" in DataCamp. 

Long short story, it began with the problem of childbed fever at the Vienna General Hospital in the early 1840s. 
Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis is the person who knows the cause of childbed fever, which is bacteria. 
Therefore, he suggested everybody at the hospital wash their hands. 
In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing.
